This little tool is designed to help shed some light on compile times of
targets in Ninja builds.

To use it, just point it at the directory where you call ninja from. It
will then attempt to reconstruct the history of your builds, outputting
JSON.

# Usage

```
Usage: NinjaTime.py INTPUT [-o|--output OUTPUT]
```

The `INPUT` is either a ninja log file, or the directory where ninja was
run. I currently only support log format version 5.

The output is a JSON file formatted in a way that chrome tracer can read
it. To use the file, open up chrome and navigate to `chrome://tracing`.
Click "Load" and select the generated JSON file.

Right now, I think that the best way is to fork the repository and make
pull requests.
